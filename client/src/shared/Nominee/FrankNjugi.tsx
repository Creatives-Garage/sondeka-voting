      <h4>The Manifestations of an Exiled Clairvoyant</h4>
      <p>
        And it is with esteemed gratification that I shall reply to the
        high-spirited letter that I receive from him. I shall tell him how the
        disclosure of his play “Ahmed’s Turban,” making its debut at the le
        theatre d’Oran that coming month, will effectuate a festive mood ne’er
        seen formerly in our home. And how his sister Gezala will verily dance
        ‘Chaouiya’ for an unimpaired one hour. Her grandmother shall practically
        ally in her moves and his father shall even pledge not to use Hookah
        until after the play. I shall, to all intents and purposes, tell him how
        we all are proud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall tell him how from the beginning I will know he is destined for
        triumph and that these happenings will authenticate that. I shall recall
        the first time I take him to school there in Tindouf. How after just a
        day, I will be told he is the best in class and how a mother could not
        be prouder. I shall remember looking at my son and murmuring a prayer to
        Allah, petitioning him to give my son an easier path than we his parents
        have had. He will know from our anecdotes during his ages as an
        ankle-biter, how we came to live at the camps in Sahrawi. I shall reckon
        he knows how exigent it is growing up in a foreign land. And I shall be
        gleeful that his adulthood will turn out to be how we all aspire it to
        be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But howbeit his letter shall abound in good tidings and applaudable
        news! I still reckon there will be something in his words that will
        leave me disconcerted. He will be elated, but the hint of self-doubt
        will leave me worried. Why would he have misgivings about his
        proficiency after all he will achieve? Why would he, the grandson of the
        valorous Brahim Mohammed from the west of the desert, doubt his ability
        to attain a Master class? Didn’t his grandfather die in the hands of
        those Moroccan soldiers so that we could have our lives in the East? He
        will wrestle a great deal to distrust his capabilities at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall harken back to the first time he will tell me that he fancies to
        become a writer. Will he remember his words? “I want to create monsters
        that I can turn into angels when I want to. I want to write about
        children who can have food whenever they want it.” He shall grow up
        wanting to be in control of his own world; something he will say. So, if
        he will be so certain he could do it in his years as a dreamer, what
        shall make him not sure especially now that he will be living his dream?
        Will the success overwhelm him or is it the fear of a debacle? I shall
        not understand. Isn’t he the same person who will stoutly come out to
        his father and disenchant him by saying he will on no account marry
        because he is different? He is the son of Fatima, the banished
        clairvoyant of the Shilha people, and he shall always know he can
        overcome anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall happily inform him that we will in plan to be in Oran on the day
        of his play. We shall all be witnesses to his rise to the top where his
        seat shall be waiting for him. I will tell him to be assured that his
        sister will be there, cheering every curtain rising and falling. I will
        tell him to be assured his father will be there; smiling at every word
        he will scribble being uttered. And I will assure him that I shall be
        there too with my heart delighting at how far he will come. We shall all
        be there to see him achieve what we all know he can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I will, I will tell him that the fear and those shakes that
        will plague him at the time are common. He will grow into a talented
        being and with that comes the diffidence he shall feel then. The Holy
        book says, “Our Lord is the one who gave to every living thing whatever
        was necessary for creation, and he directed,” so he shall have Allah’s
        guidance perpetually. Allah is the one who shall give him this burden.
        This gift he shall sometimes see as a curse. This hankering to work and
        achieve all he can. I shall tell him to never distress because this
        curse is the best gift one could ever have. I shall tell him all this
        and more. But at this moment I can do nothing much but bottle feed him,
        to make him strong enough for the journey we shall undertake in an
        attempt to leave the shackles of ostracization that has kept us hostage
        in these camps of Sahrawi.
