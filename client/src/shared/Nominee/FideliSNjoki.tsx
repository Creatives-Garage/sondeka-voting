        I am standing on the wet sand. I have been walking around with a haze
        over my eyes for some time now but I can see that the water is coming my
        dear. It is rippling all the way to the shore. The brown dead seaweed
        caresses my legs and the fingerlings swarm at my calves with their
        curiosity getting the best of them as they rub against my skin. I am
        standing so still that they do not startle at my presence as they would
        have if I had waded through the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday, I went out to sea. The sky was beautifully blue as I watched
        the sun emerge and rise into the expansive sky. I stood by the beach and
        watched the water flow away, sporadically revealing shells and crab
        holes bubbling up with wet sand.
      </p>
      <p>
        My feet were gradually sinking into the wet sand as I stood there and
        thought of how I am an ocean of want. A vast and ravenous sea of desire.
        Desire to know, to have, to hold, to consume, to take, and to worship.
        Desire to desire to desire and to desire. I was a curious child and now
        I have grown into a woman who wants to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to know so much. I am so greedy that I must grasp things tightly
        and bring them to my face, up to my nose first to smell them then down
        to my mouth to taste them. I need to feel them and know them. I cannot
        see the edge of the sea with my bare eyes, not even with my glasses on.
        A voice within me asks what it is that makes me assume that I will reach
        the peak of knowledge. If I cannot see the edge of the sea then how can
        I know everything? How can I understand what exactly grief is? I want to
        know and logicize my way around it so that it might not cut as it does.
        My desire to know blinds me to the fact that some conclusions are
        unreachable havens. Impossibilities that I sure will never learn about
        for who am I? Am I more special than the men of old who struggled to
        grasp the fruit of knowledge from the gods, overflowed with it, and set
        it down into books? Am I the one who salvaged the scrolls that Caesar
        caused to burn? Where is this profound knowledge that I think I possess?
        Is it stored in the crevices of my brain, waiting to be pulled out by
        some profound epiphany? I know but I do not know. I need clarity in
        knowing for I am a blind traveler. I am stumbling against heaps of sand
        sprawled on the hot ground with no vision and the threat of toppling
        over gripping my ankles with unseen strings. I am stumbling on the beach
        of knowing with my astigmatic eyes. My stability is wavering and I am
        tripping every few steps, lurching forward with the threat of blindly
        crashing against the hot sand rising with every step that I take. In my
        dreams, we sit together by the beach and talk, of nothing and of
        everything. In these dreams, nothing has gone wrong. Everything is okay
        and we laugh. I break a splinter off of a fallen palm tree by the beach
        and move toward your face, using it to pull out the fruit stuck between
        your teeth. In my dreams, you are here and we look into each
        other&apos;s eyes and laugh foolishly. You are here and you are whole.
        Nothing is real of course. These are only fleeting dreams. It has been
        way too long and now I think that I must bury my legs in the sand and
        wait for the water to return. I should stand there and wait for it so
        that it might hold me down below the surface, to feel what you once felt
        as your legs touched the seabed and you slept on it. The finality that
        lay in your acceptance of an end–that you would cease to be. How can I
        understand what you felt in those last moments? I have always had this
        unpleasant behavior of thinking that things will not happen to me, like
        how I spilled water on my computer keyboard and it stopped working, only
        then did I actually understand the warnings uttered to me before. Only
        then did they become real. Of how I ate with dirty hands because I knew
        I would never get sick. Discomfort followed and so I did learn. Or how I
        did not see death as tangible until I watched our puppy die in my
        brother&apos;s arms, death to me became real then. The novelty of it
        wore off and I thought I would learn and adapt but then I was so wrong.
        Unlike other things this is the absolute disappearance of someone, never
        to be seen again. The naivety of a fantasy of everlasting life for
        everyone around me as they are, not with a loss involved. What a
        blindingly foolish thought I had back then. The day always begins and it
        passes with my feet deep in the salty sand. I grieve you and still, it
        does not become bearable. Why did I never learn about the neverending
        nature of grief despite learning so much? Why is my understanding of
        grief so unclear and ragged? Why is there no clear route around grief
        with no whiplash? Just like the ones who came before me, I struggle to
        understand why our hearts contort painfully at loss. What causes the
        pain to come physically? Why is existence doomed to be plagued by such?
        Why? It is an inevitability but the shock is always resounding. It
        cripples me and sends me down to my knees to grab the sand with my bare
        hands. Each time I experience loss it shatters me anew. The grief never
        completely leaves and so I have to make do with it, like a scar on
        one&apos;s face that always lingers.
      </p>

        Perhaps the sea has answers to my questions, the sea carries death in it
        after all. The sea is old and it has seen so much, much like the moon I
        sometimes hold in my dreams. Ancient wonders might have the answers to
        everything. … Yesterday too, I went out to sit in the water with my
        anguish. Side by side, we sat and side by side we cried the whole night
        with our arms Interlocked. I set my feet in the sand and the warmth of
        the sea encompassed my fully clothed body. With the weight of water in
        the fabric of my dress, it clung onto my skin, my bony hips gaining
        prominence under the dull moonlight. Like a marble sculpture, I did not
        move from where I stood. I let the grief course through my body, under
        my skin, through my hair follicles, at my swelling glottis, and through
        my toes. … Presently, the humid salty air has dug its way into my lungs
        through my nose, and out of my mouth. I have gotten so much sea salt in
        my blood. Tears are salty and so to me, there is not much of a
        difference between these tears and the raging water of the sea. The
        grief is never-ending and is within me now, a part of me. The day begins
        with this grief. The day ends with this same grief. The blade of grief
        blunts with time but it still cuts through my body. This grief is an
        inescapable reality and so I must stand up from the water. I must wash
        off the sand in my hollow collarbones and stop my weeping. I must wash
        the seaweed from my hair and stand underneath the water until it stops
        being salty. There is no salt in my blood anymore for my blood itself
        has become salt and so I must stop mourning. I must make do.
