      <h3>Visitors Day</h3>

        Some visitors arrived with new buckets, powder detergents, and bar soap.
        They did the laundry, relieving residents of weekend tasks. They cleaned
        common areas and donated water tanks to promote good hygiene. Others
        made lunch, cooking on site or arriving with caterers who prepared
        chapatis or chips. They washed the dishes after sharing sodas. Then
        there were the visitors who were most enthusiastic about play. They came
        with whistles, skipping ropes, balls, and toys. Coaching their hosts,
        they praised talent and joy. Children and adults laughed and played
        themselves hoarse.

        Clarissa, new to the Children of Love Home, noticed how fellow residents
        adjusted for these weekend visitors. Farida wore her pink lacey dress
        and clung to visitors’ hands while showing them around. Collins rehashed
        his famous-politician accents, delighting in visitors’ cackles. Rosina’s
        singing went tremolo while leading welcome and thank you songs. Twins
        Rael and Joel acted younger than nine years old, following visitors
        everywhere. Clarissa around visitors was demure, stumbling through
        sentences whenever she was spoken to. She preferred wearing her baggiest
        clothes, to hide what she had stolen from the donations.

        Love’s residents couldn’t hold onto the idea of Father Christmas, not
        when he appeared at each visit, skinny, or chubby, or with a cottony
        beard that fell off mid-conversation, or white, and then black. But
        whoever he was, they chased him around, singing, “Father Christmas!
        Father Christmas!” Some Father Christmases didn’t carry enough gifts for
        everyone. Clarissa understood that all visitors’ offers and requests
        were to be received with gratitude and enthusiasm, always! On this
        visit, Clarissa had joined in applauding the “surprise” of roast beef,
        weeding the vegetable garden alongside the guests, and the impromptu
        dancing contest where she had known to perform in a style that wouldn’t
        get her in trouble with Mama Kemi, her house mother. Clarissa had envied
        her brothers and sisters who got assigned to show the visitors around,
        but this time she got her turn, too. She hadn’t enjoyed it. A woman in
        the group she’d been paired with sighed and applauded. “Lovely,
        Clarissa!” she said. “You are so clever!” she added, patting Clarissa’s
        shoulder. This woman asked about Clarissa’s real family. “Where do you
        come from?” She wanted details on Clarissa’s schooling, her grades, her
        dreams, and whether she had a relationship with Jesus. Clarissa on
        ordinary days didn’t ever call the guardians at Love Home Mummy and
        Daddy—they weren’t that to her—but for the visitors she did. Mummy
        Josina, Daddy Samson, and Mama Kemi were the only parents she knew, she
        said. Clarissa stood among the rows of boys and girls, in front of their
        home’s signboard and the wall with a faded mural of boys and girls. She
        was among 22 of the 56 of Mummy and Daddy’s charges present that day.
        The majority had gone away for scheduled family visits. Three boys,
        John, Karisa, and Micah, had jumped over the fence and run away. The
        visitors, 15 men and women in lime green company T-shirts printed for
        this occasion, lined up behind the children. One of the men squatted in
        the front row among the youngest kids. The items they had brought—gunny
        sacks with used clothes, new toys, toiletries, books, and food— were
        piled in around the scene. Small items were unpacked and handed out for
        the photos. When the photographers said “smile,” the children waved bars
        of soap, packets of biscuits, exercise books, and two footballs.
        Clarissa waved her packet of sanitary towels. In their minivan, the
        visitors discussed improving the home in the new year. Maybe they could
        set up a fundraising website? You know, do something more impactful. Or
        they could solicit a brand partner to repaint the walls? They considered
        revamping the dilapidated hall, one of them calculating the costs. They
        agreed it was a day well spent. Some dozed from exertion. It was the
        last week of work before their office shut down for Christmas break.
        They spoke about the children who had really tugged at their hearts.
        Like nervous and shy teen Clarissa. They hadn’t had a chance to visit
        the baby nursery; they’d prioritize it for the next trip. As the
        visitors left, Clarissa along with other upper primary boys and girls
        stepped forward to carry the donated items to the store, where they’d be
        sorted and then sold. Out of one of the boxes, she snatched a pack of
        girls’ panties and placed it in her loose dungaree pocket. She looked
        around. Nobody had seen her. Leaving the store, Clarissa walked to the
        yellow house. The paint on its walls was long faded. It had been just
        nine months since she’d been assigned to live here with the other
        brothers and sisters. Things quieted down as Love’s residents scattered
        to their houses. Night security guards walked around the compound,
        passing the houses—yellow, green, brown, blue—on the way down to the
        three-story hostels where the older girls and boys lived. Children drew
        the curtains and switched on the lights, falling back into their regular
        Saturday evening routines. It would soon be time for supper.
        Anticlimactic rice and beans for most, like the slow worship songs at
        the end of raucous prayer, tongue speaking, and dancing. A return to
        order. Though she was the oldest girl in the yellow house, Clarissa had
        little clout as she was two years behind her high school-going agemates
        who lived in the hostels. Mama Kemi was kind but picky. At the yellow
        house, if they overslept, or didn’t mop the bathroom floor to her
        liking, or if they didn’t wash and shine the cooking utensils as she
        preferred, she’d get worked up. As she wasn’t allowed to beat them, she
        shouted instructions and ordered the children to repeat tasks over and
        over. Clarissa preferred beatings. Couldn’t Mama Kemi just beat them,
        Clarissa thought. Mama Kemi wasn’t home yet. Clarissa’s sisters were
        already in the girls’ bedroom. Clarissa sought a place to hide the
        panties; night inspection loomed after visitors day.
