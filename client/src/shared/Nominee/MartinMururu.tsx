      <h3>REVELATION</h3>
      <h3>Delta Colony</h3>
      <h3>Sol Jovis 12th of Mina, Year 2224</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Eve Arcadia. A Proud Martian. I am eight years old.
        That’s equivalent to sixteen years on Earth. In case you’re wondering,
        Sol Jovis is a day name. Not a place. Much like how guys from Earth have
        Monday, Tuesday and the rest I can’t remember? Yeah. We use the Darian
        calendar for our system of timekeeping. We have seven Sols in a week;
        What can also be called days; Sol Solis, Sol Lunae, Sol Martis, Sol
        Mercurii, Sol Jovis, Sol Veneris and Sol Saturni.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s best I do a tiny bit of introduction. I honestly don’t take
        Inter-planetary history classes seriously but I do have enough mental
        resources to walk you through the basics. Actually, bearing my current
        situation, I despise history class. So like about 200 years ago, the
        human race was a one-planet civilization. Some guy discovered geysers on
        our planet Mars and harnessed them for energy. I don’t remember the guy
        and I don’t care. You might call it negligence and apathy but everything
        and everyone comes and goes. Time and the Universe don’t care who
        invented the gun or who took a shit where and when. Everything simply
        moves on. One day, there’ll be a completely different civilization and
        form of life which will definitely not care shit about fuck except
        moving on towards its own goals and ambitions. Simply put, no one gives
        a full fuck about anyone or anything. Trust me. That’s why I choose to
        live the moment and not care about what or who is documenting my life.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we were at the geyser thingy majiggies. Right, there were four spots
        identified on Mars with geysers. That’s where the four current colonies
        were built around; Alpha, Beta, Charlie and Delta. I am from the Delta
        Colony. It’s the youngest of all. It officially became life sustaining
        about 30 years ago. Oh and Mina is the name for our eighth month. We
        have a total of twenty four months in a year. I bet you’ve caught
        up-well at least for the basics. I’ll explain other stuff along the way.
        However, right now, I’m kinda like in trouble. Okay, I am in deep
        trouble. Balls deep. Hot sizzling soup. Code red. Life and death
        situation. There’s a constant alert beep that’s been going on for five
        minutes. I can’t tell what it’s for because I crashed my helmet on a
        rock or something, busting the Heads-Up-Display on my visor. Also, I can
        see a tiny crack on the glass. Good thing there’s no air escaping
        through it as far as I can tell. Our history teacher decided to take us
        on a tour outside the colony perimeter to see one of the earliest
        wreckages of Space crafts from Earth. We were each given a life support
        suit and allowed to wander off about the wreckage. A life support suit
        is basically a space suit, with an oxygen tank, set of high voltage
        battery packs, communication kit and a temperature control system. We
        were tagged with a mate. Mine was Edith. I hope she’s fine because the
        last time I saw her was when the furious dust storm hit us and everyone
        was blown away in different directions. My tag cord snapped and I lost
        Edith. I blacked out a bit when I hit the ground and my head slammed
        onto the hardened visor. I think that’s the best explanation of what
        happened. I can’t remember much. I woke up six minutes ago and found
        myself buried in the dirt up to my neck. I can’t move any of my limbs.
        The dirt is too dense and extremely heavy. The dust storm is still high
        at play, I can see and hear tiny rocks smashing and bouncing off of my
        visor. My vision is limited to an arm’s length away because of the cloud
        of red dust rushing past me. I can’t turn to see what’s behind me so I
        have no idea where I am in reference to my environment. The alert beep
        is still going on. It could be because my battery pack is running dry or
        my oxygen is leaking. You’re wondering about the comms. That was
        obviously the first thing I tried. However, I’ve been having a pretty
        decent conversation with static. “Mayday mayday, this is Eve Arcadia
        from Delta, does anybody copy?” I say again, for like the 7th time. I
        get nothing but the constant flat static hiss. I’m very sure a search
        team is on its way, so that’s why I keep trying out the comms every
        minute. A rover might pass by and get in range of my signal and I’ll be
        back inside the colony in no time. Such incidences occur every once in a
        while; Someone goes outside the colony, dust storm happens, they get
        stranded somewhere in the Red, search team is deployed, takes five
        minutes or so, they find the poor soul’s homing signal from their
        Birthchip…yada yada, the poor soul is found and rescued. I’m the poor
        soul now. One rule about getting lost outside the colonies, don’t panic.
        You’ll just end up using more oxygen. Soon it’ll run out and eventually
        you’ll suffocate. Then die. “Mayday mayday, this is Eve Arcadia from
        Delta, does anybody copy?” I say. Static. Oh no. The bane of being
        inside these spacesuit junks. An itch. I can feel my nose itching. Shit.
        I turn my head and try to reach out for the edge where the visor meets
        the metal frame. I stretch up a bit until my neck hurts but I don’t mind
        because my nose is as close as burning right now. I somehow manage to
        reach it and make continuous satisfyingly scratchy nodding gestures
        against the steel frame. A shadow suddenly dashes past above my visor. I
        saw it in my periphery. Finally. “Mayday mayday, this is Eve Arcadia
        from Delta, does anybody copy?” I say. Static. “Mayday mayday, this is
        Eve Arcadia from Delta, do you read me?” I say, this time more loudly.
        My broadcast is followed by nothing but static. Maybe it’s a small
        asteroid. Mars gets those. Especially on this time of the year. I try to
        move my arms and legs to no success. I’m still stuck as ever. I wonder
        how Edith is doing. Something suddenly hits the back of my helmet. I
        can’t turn. Neither can I feel with my hands. “Mayday mayday, this is
        Eve Arcadia from Delta, does anybody copy?” I say. Static. I hear
        footsteps crunching the dirt behind me. The steps are heavy. More than
        the largest person I know from our colony. They’re not human. I can tell
        that because I can feel the dirt I’m enclosed in shaking. I don’t recall
        animals in the history of Mars. The footsteps appear to be approaching
        my front. Honestly, I’m a bit spooked. “Mayday mayday, this is Eve
        Arcadia from Delta, do you copy?” I say with hesitation. Static. A heavy
        and metallic claw like foot suddenly digs into the dirt in front of me.
        “Mayday mayday, this is Eve Arcadia from Delta, does anybody copy!” My
        breathing is changing from okay to definitely not okay. The metallic
        claw descends deeper into the dirt, then stops. I suddenly feel
        something grip around my waist. Fuck. That breaks me. “Hello!” I shout.
        “Who’s there!” Static. I’m beginning to shake. What the fuck, aliens? Or
        some animal nobody has discovered yet. I might be some thing’s lunch! I
        feel the claw pulling me out from under the dirt. My hands get free and
        my waist loosens up. I manage to turn halfway around to get a good look.
        I only see a vague shadow and two huge faint orange glows in the cloud
        of red dust. My legs get free but I’m helpless with the claw around my
        waist. The claw then pulls me closer towards the two orange lights. My
        vision gets better with every inch I get closer to the object. I finally
        get closer enough to get a clear sight. Edith smiles from inside the
        WalkerCrane. She waves. I finally breathe out as Edith places me on the
        ground. I wrestle the fast wind and dirt towards the Walker. Edith opens
        the airlock and lets me inside. “Your antenna broke. That’s why we
        couldn’t get responses from each other.” Edith says. “However, I scanned
        your Birthchip’s location with the Walker’s radar. That’s how I found
        you.” “What would I do without you?” I laugh. I place my helmet on the
        floor and take the copilot seat. I down a bottle of water. “The search
        team really did take their time this time round. We’re lucky I found the
        Walker, otherwise my oxygen would have run out and you’d be buried
        alive.” “Yeah no shit.” I say. “Have you heard from anyone else from
        class?” “Nope.” Edith says. “Just you. Want a carrot? Straight from the
        greenhouse.” “Sign me up. I almost starved.” I say. “Hey are you doing
        anything this weekend?” “What else besides stealing a rover and rocking
        out with Hoverboards on Gale?” Edith asks. I smile. The ride is boring
        as fuck. No sight-seeing because of the damn storm and the thing we’re
        on moves like five miles a year. And no mp3 player! Who the Marsduck
        drives without music? I decide to skip time by taking a small nap.
        Darkness. Hi, my name is Eve Arcadia. Proud Martian. I am eight years
        old. That’s equivalent to sixteen years on Earth. We’re on Sol Jovis,
        12th of Mina in the year 2224. In case you’re wondering, Sol Jovis is a
        day name. Not a place. Like how guys from Earth have Monday, Tuesday and
        the rest of the crap I can’t remember? Yeah. We use the Darian calendar
        for our system of timekeeping. We have seven Sols in a week; Sol Solis,
        Sol Lunae, Sol Martis, Sol Mercurii, Sol Jovis, Sol Veneris and Sol
        Saturni. I bet you’ve caught up-well at least for the basics. I’ll
        explain other stuff along the way. However, right now, I’m kinda like in
        trouble. Okay, I am in deep trouble. Balls deep. Hot sizzling soup. Code
        red. Life and… _______________________ “Her real name is Tiffany Brune.
        She was charged with armed robbery in Sector 5. She was one of the
        enforcement personnel there. We don’t have enough rooms in the
        Speculation to act as prison cells and sure as hell we cannot throw rule
        breakers outside so I opted for a suspended animation. At least, until
        we arrive at Alpha Centauri. It’s been two years since we woke from the
        Hypersleep. We’re out of range from Earth’s communication and people are
        getting queasy. Others are panicking. Some think we won’t make it to
        Centauri, others think that the food ration is getting lower and they’ll
        eventually starve to death…all these, it drives them crazy and they
        result to committing crimes against themselves; Robbery, assault,
        domestic violence, it’s getting worse by the day, Captain.” “And how
        long will this suspended animation last?” Captain Kage asked. “As long
        as there’s power, every prisoner is stuck in their simulated sequence.”
        Dimitri answered. Towering before the two men, a large cylindrical hall
        is walled with pods housing bodies placed under hibernation, their minds
        being fed fake scenarios and realities to keep them asleep for their
        prescribed amounts of time. “I still think this is favoring the wrong
        doers.” President Kage said. “I mean, giving them a life as soft as
        that? Having them take a nap while the good ones are working their
        fingers and brains off to keep the ship on course?” “Patience, Captain.”
        Dimitri said. “It’s all a matter of revelation.” Dimitri turned to the
        monitor with Tiffany’s brain activity feed showing. ______________
        “Hello!” I shout. “Who’s there!” Static. I feel the claw pulling me out
        from under the dirt. My hands get free and my waist loosens up. I manage
        to turn halfway around to get a good look…wait a minute. I’ve been here
        before. The fuck is going on? I make out a Walker as the claw slowly
        pulls me towards it. I kinda feel like I’ve been here before. I board
        the Walker and detach my helmet. “Do you feel anything weird?” I ask
        Edith. “Like how the search team hasn’t gotten here already?” Edith
        asks. Edit hasn’t realized it yet. “No, I mean it’s as if we’re reliving
        this moment again.” I say. “You need a nap girl.” Edith says. Maybe I
        actually do. Who knows how hard I hit my head. “Wake me up when we reach
        the colony. I’ll be seeing the doc ASAP.”I say. I then ease into the
        chair to fall asleep. Darkness. I hear cluttering. Like small pebbles
        being thrown at a glass. I can’t move my legs nor my arms. There’s a
        constant alert beep. I flung my eyes open. Same suit, same dust storm
        same fucking nightmare. I am definitely not losing my mind. I wait for
        the crane thing. Minutes later, I hear the familiar crunch. What in the
        actual fried fucking greaseball is going on? I board the Walker-Again.
        “Edith, you don’t see this?” I ask, immediately my helmet is off. I drop
        it on the floor. “See what?” Edith asks. Is she blind? Like the stupid
        version of blind? She can’t notice the same scenario the second time?
        “You okay?” Edith asks. “Hey let’s get you back to the colony and have
        someone check on you. You must have inhaled some gas. Your visor is
        cracked, did you notice?” Am I losing my mind? Alright. Last freaking
        time. If I find myself here again then something is totally off. I sit
        at the co-pilot’s seat. “Carrot?” Edith holds out a fresh carrot. I grab
        it and devour it. Delicious. “Hey if you’re not feeling okay you can
        take a nap.” Edith says. “You’ll get back at the colony in no time.”
        Edith is right. I find a comfortable position on the shitty chair and
        start fantasizing how life would be on a totally habitable planet.
        Walking to absolutely anywhere I want, no restrictions and the
        atmosphere isn’t there to murder you. Darkness. Clutter. I hear clutter.
        Small bits of things smashing against something hard. I can hear fast
        moving wind. The alert beep. I’m back in the life support suit. Fuck me
        four times with a pogo stick. Surely if Edith hasn’t noticed this… “What
        do you mean you haven’t noticed anything!” I scream at Edith. She has
        stopped the Walker and has shifted her position to face me. She looks at
        me with curious eyes. “Are you brainwashed to not see stuff, Edith?” I
        ask. An idea hits me. “Alright alright.” I say as I sit and buckle up at
        the co-pilot seat. “Let’s get to the colony and I’m not taking a nap.
        Because every time I did, I went back to that same fucking spot in the
        ground.” Edith shrugs her shoulders. “As you wish.” She says. “Fuck
        yeah.” I say. “What?” Edith asks. “You’re gonna ask if I want a carrot.”
        I say. “What, you got telepathy now?” she asks. “No, it’s because I know
        what’s going to happen.” I say. “Lucky.” Edith says. “Your face looks so
        punchy right now.” I say. I then munch on the carrot. It was simple.
        Don’t fall asleep. Darkness. “Shit!” I curse. “Shit shit shit shit
        shi…”The alert beep keeps on. Red cloud rushes by me outside my helmet.
        The clutter continues. I hear the crunch. I see the claw. “Edith! I
        fucking swear on the fucking swear itself that I’ve been here before.” I
        look at Edith with a super sharp face. “Of course.” Edith says.
        “Everybody has, you moron. We live here.” “No I don’t mean…” I choose to
        scream. “You okay?” Edith asks. “Do I look okay to you?” I shout. “Get
        your ass of that chair, I’m driving us.” “But you can’t…” “I’m not
        asking again.” I have my superduper threat mode engaged. Edith raises
        her hands in surrender and moves to the co-pilot seat. “Just remember,
        turn on the Walker and use the joy stick to control the direction you
        want it to go towards. There’s the NavScreen, the green dot is our
        colony and the blue one’s us. The red areas on the map are depressions.
        The extremely yellow ones are steep hills so be very careful not to…”
        “Crash it, I know.” I say. I need to get to the colony and find out what
        this is. “Take it slow.” Edith says. “It’s very powerful.” “Well, we’re
        in luck.” I say then slide the throttle to the max. The ride is jumpy,
        like piloting one of those animals from earth. Horses or Ponies I think,
        but the shake is tolerable. I can’t see well with the red cloud covering
        everywhere. I still push on. The Nav thingy shows me where to go so we
        should be fine as long as…SHIT! A rock suddenly appears and shatters
        through the reinforced glass shield. The little oxygen we have gets
        sucked out into the thin atmosphere as the red dust and whatever the
        fuck gas comes rushing into my lungs. I watch my skin burn from the
        radiation as I gag out and try to breathe nothing. My head throbs and a
        flash of white dominates my vision. Darkness. Clutter. Constant alert
        beep. Fuck me. “So anytime she sleeps or goes unconscious or dies, she
        gets ‘re-spawned’ to the time I set, which is when she is buried. I then
        reveal to her the time paradox.” Dimitri said. “And it goes over and
        over and over and over, resulting to agony. How’s that for punishment?”
        “It’s all a matter of revelation.” Captain Kage whispers. “Yup.” Dimitri
        says. “Now they’ll be that way until we arrive at Alpha Centauri. I
        believe there will be an abundance of prison cells. As for the moment,
        let’s make good use of the hibernation berths. Trust me, Captain, when
        one of the prisoners gets out and tells their story, crime would be the
        last thing you need to worry about in this vessel. Now that we have that
        settled, Captain, how about we find a way to safely navigate past the
        approaching black hole?”
